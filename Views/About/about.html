            <h2>Co-Founder Kathleen McGinley</h2>
            <br>
            <p>After graduating fashion school in LA Kathleen moved back to begin her career in the big apple.  After a few months working in the city she met my husband Dan (we call him Dan the Man around here, more on him later***).  Kathleen stayed in children’s fashion for 8 years.  Meeting some of the smartest women in the world, learning from most powerful women in the industry, traveling to Italy, attending fashion shows, she gave it her all.  Then quickly ( & happily) shifted her drive from the industry to raising twin girls Ella & Riley.  When they were almost one TMC was established.  It wasn’t until a little while later while pregnant with Jack that she and Casey were crazy enough to follow a dream and a hunch and we booked their first Paint & Prosecco Party with their fabulous group of friends.  Last year they added an amazing designer and close friend Meg to help keep TMC fresh.  Always having the best fonts and on point designs (we lover her!). <br> Note from Kathleen- Having fun and meeting amazing women around Long Island is our favorite part of TMC!   We cannot thank you all enough for the support and inviting us into your homes each week to create memories for you are your best friends.  We hope we have the chance to meet you at your very own #paintandproseccoparty </p>

            <h2>Co-Founder Casey Stewart</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Here are a couple of fun facts! Casey joined TMC In January of 2017 when Kathleen was pregnant with her third child...Jack! During the week, she is an Occupational Therapist with a specialty in rehabilitating traumatic brain and spinal injuries. Her and her husband Jon met in 2010, where they fell in love with his big heart and stellar dance moves:: sarcasm::. They got married, moved back to Long Island, and got an energetic puppy (Dexter). After lots of love, prayers, and science, they recently added a beautiful baby girl, Gemma to their family. Casey can be found on her boat or at the beach with her toes in the sand while sipping on prosecco with my friends & family. TMC is her outlet to have fun, socialize, and be creative! <br> Note from Casey: Thank YOU for booking a party, ordering a custom sign, or purchasing a monogram as you have given me the opportunity for a family.</p>

            <h2>Designer Megan Maxwell</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Meg has a background in advertising and marketing, but never really did find her niche - until she discovered graphic design and a serious love for fonts.  Meg did a little happy dance when Kathleen and Casey asked her to be a part of the team! After dabbling in invitation design, which she loved, nothing has felt more like a fit than this gig does right here.  The story of how she met my husband is your typical romance: late night bar, a couple of drinks, and some serious dance moves. But really, he has some moves! They quickly fell in love, moved, got married, moved some more, had twins, moved again, and here we are! By day Meg is a stay-at-home mom to the world’s cutest three-year-olds. You can find Meg at the beach, hanging out with her family (who happen to live across the street) and having Friday night dance parties in their kitchen! The Maxwell’s are currently expecting another baby girl and can’t wait to complete their family. <br> Note from Meg- I feel so lucky to do something I love with two of the best people (and supermoms! For real, these girls are amazing) I know. Thank you for supporting us and making this dream a reality!</p>

            <h2>Director of Workshop Dan McGinley</h2>
            <br>
            <p>With all of the success TMC has had (which we are forever grateful) it would have been a lot harder maybe not even possible without Dan. The Monogram Crew started because of this stud... I’ll share the story another day. This awesome, generous man heads to his workshop and cuts board after board adds frames then hammers hanger after hanger.  Dan has never once complained; never once told us it was too much to do after working his real job and has maybe rolled his eyes once (twice). Instead he encourages the crew in every way! Every day he pushes us to do better, to be smarter in business, inspires me to work on new projects knowing it’s him that has to do all the work behind the scenes. TMC is as important in his world as his real job and for that we are forever grateful. We appreciate his support and hard work, but most importantly you believing in this crazy dream just as much as the crew does! </p>
